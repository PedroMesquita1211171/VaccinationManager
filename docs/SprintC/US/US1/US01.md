# US 01 - Scheduling a vaccine as an SNS user

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an SNS user, I intend to use the application to schedule a vaccine*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

> (...) To take a vaccine, the SNS user should use the application to schedule his/her vaccination. The user
> should introduce his/her SNS user number, select the vaccination center, the date (...)

> (...) Then, the application should check the
> vaccination center capacity for that day/time and, if possible, confirm that the vaccination is
> scheduled and inform the user that (s)he should be at the selected vaccination center at the
> scheduled day and time. (...)

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

*An SNS user cannot schedule the same vaccine more than once;

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*US 3, US 9 and US 12; As we will need to log into the application as an SNS user, schedule the vacciantion at a vacciantion center and choose the type of vaccine respectively*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**
* Typed Data:
    *Time slot

* Selected Data:*
    * Vaccination center
    * Type of vaccine

**Output Data:**
* (In)Success of the operation
* Confirmation of vaccine scheduling


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...                      | Answer                        | Justification (with patterns)                                                    |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |
| Step 1  		     | 	validating the sns number (if it registeresd)?							           | SNSUserStore                  | Information Expert (knows all the SNSUser objects)                               |
| Step 2  		     | 	showing the vaccination centers and asking to select one?						 | ScheduleVaccineUI             | Information Expert(responsible for user interaction)                       |
| Step 3  		     | 	showing the vaccine and asking to select one?						             | ScheduleVaccineUI             | Information Expert(responsible for user interaction) |              
| Step 4  		     | 	requesting the date to schedule?						                          | ReceptionistScheduleVaccineUI | Information Expert(responsible for user interaction)                             |
| Step 5  		     | 	Validating the date (if any vaccine is already scheduled)						 | ScheduleVaccineStore          | Information Expert(knows all the ScheduleVaccine Objects).                       |
| Step 6  		     | 	Saving the scheduling of a vaccine?						                       | ScheduleVaccineStore          | Information Expert(in charge of managing/recording all ScheduleVaccine Objects). |              
| Step 7  		     | 	Informing operation sucess?						                               | ReceptionistScheduleVaccineUI | Information Expert(responsible for user interaction)                             |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Company
* ScheduleVaccine

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* ReceptionistScheduleVaccineUI  (Pure Fabrication)
* ReceptionistScheduleVaccineController (Controller)
* ScheduleVaccineStore (Information Expert)

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![USXXX-SD](US010_SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![USXXX-CD](US010_CD.svg)

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
