# US 011 - Employee list

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As an administrator, I want to get a list of Employees with a given function/role.*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the client clarifications:**

>


**From the client clarifications:**


> **Question: Besides the name of the employee, what other attributes do we need to show on the list? Can we show every single attribute, including password and username?**
>
> **Answer: The application should present all Employee attributes.
Password is not an Employee attribute..**

> **Question: Regarding US011, is there any requirement or input that the Administrator must insert to get the list of the employees? What are the criteria that those employees need to meet to appear on that list? Does the list of employees have any relevance on the functionality of the application? Should we assume SNSUsers must also appear on that list?**
>
> **Answer: I just answered a question that will clarify your doubts. Moreover, the SNS user is not an Employee.**

> **Question: Should we give the user the possibility of listing employees from more than 1 role?**
>
> Answer: The Administrator should select a given role and all employees associated with the selected role should be listed.

> **Question: Should the list be sorted in any specific way(for example alphabetical name order) or should we give the option to sort by other characteristics?**
> 
> Answer: For now I just want to get a list of employees without considering the order of presentation.
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

*No acceptance criteria given.*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*Class Company, where the employees and their respective roles are registered.*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**
* Typed Data: (none)
* Selected Data:
    * Role

**Output Data:**

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              
| Step 7  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 8  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 9  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 10  		 |							 |             |                              |  


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Company
 * Employee
 * EmployeeStore

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * AdminUI  
 * SpecifyNewEmployeeController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
