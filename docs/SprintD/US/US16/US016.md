# US 016 - Center Coordinator

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*As a center coordinator, I intend to analyze the performance of a center*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the Specifications Document:**
* This US should implement a procedure that, for a specific time of day, and intervals of m minutes  chosen by the coordinator, with a daily work from 8AM to 8PM the procecdure creates a list of length 720/m;
* The i-th value of the list is the difference between the number of clients arriving and the number of clients leaving at that i-th time interval.
* The application should implement a brute force algorithm to determine the contiguous sublist of maximum sum;


**From the client clarifications:**
> Question : The file loaded in US17 have only one day to analyse or it could have more than one day(?) and in US16 we need to select the day to analyse from 8:00 to 20:00?
> Answer: The file can have data from more than one day. In US16 the center coordinator should select the day for which he wants to analyse the performance of the vaccination center.

>Question: "Should the configuration file be defined , manually, before strating the program? Or Should an administrator or another DGS entity be able to alter the file in a user interface? This question is also important for US06 and US16 since these US also use configuration files, will the same process be applied to them?"
>Answer: The configuration file should be edited manually.

>Question: "Is the time of departure of an SNS user the time he got vaccinated plus the recovery time or do we have another way of knowing it?"
>Answer: The time of departure of an SNS user is the time he got vaccinated plus the recovery time.

>Question: "In US 16, should the coordinator have the option to choose which algorithm to run (e.g. via a configuration file or while running the application) in order to determine the goal sublist, or is the Benchmark Algorithm strictly for drawing comparisons with the Bruteforce one?"
>Answer: The algorithm to run should be defined in a configuration file.

>Question: "I would like to ask that if to analyse the performance of a center, we can assume (as a pre requirement) that the center coordinator was already attributed to a specific vaccination center and proceed with the US as so (like the center coordinator does not have to choose at a certain point where he is working. This is already treated before this US happens). Could you clarify this?"
>Answer: A center coordinator can only coordinate one vaccination center. The center coordinator can only analyze the performance of the center that he coordinates.

>Question: "I would like to know if we could strict the user to pick only those intervals (m) (i.e. 1, 5, 10, 20, 30) as options for analyzing the performance of a center, since picking intervals is dependent on the list which is 720/m (which the length is an integer result). If we let the user pick an interval that results in a non-integer result, this will result in an invalid list since some data for the performance analysis will be lost. Can you provide a clarification on this situation?"
>Answer: The user can introduce any interval value. The system should validate the interval value introduced by the user.
