# US 015 - Get Vaccination Statistics

## 1. Requirements Engineering



### 1.1. User Story Description

As a center coordinator, I intend to check and export vaccination statistics. I want to export, to a csv file, the total number of fully vaccinated users per day.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

*Insert here any related specification and/or clarification provided by the client together with **your interpretation**. When possible, provide a link to such specifications/clarifications.*

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

*Insert here the client acceptance criteria.*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*Identify here any found out dependency to other US and/or requirements.*
us8-there need to be vaccinated users 

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**
* Typed Data:
   * Time frame 
* Selected Data: 
   * vaccination center

**Output Data:**
* (In)Success of the operation
* File ???

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...     | Answer                               | Justification (with patterns)                      |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1  	      | ...interacting with the actor?                  | CheckVaccinationStatisticsUI         | Pure Fabrication                                   |
|                | ...coordinating the us?                         | CheckVaccinationStatisticsController | Controller ?????                                   |
| Step 2  	      | ...knowing the available vaccination centers?   | VaccinationCenterStore               | Creator (Rule 1):Store has all vaccination centers |
| Step 3  	      | ...knowing the vaccination data for the center? | VaccinationStore                     | Creator (Rule 1): Store has all vaccination data   |
| Step 4  	      | ...creating the file?                           |                                      |                                                    |              
| Step 5  	      | ...informing that the operation was successful? | CheckVaccinationStatisticsUI         | IE: is responsible for all user interactions       |


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Class1
* Class2
* Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* xxxxUI
* xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![US015-SD](US015-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
